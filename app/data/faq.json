      "question": "What requirements must a client meet to receive forms through the portal?",
      "answer": "The client must: (1) have an active portal account, (2) have a valid email address registered in their profile, and (3) be able to authenticate in the portal (web or mobile). Without these requirements, the client will not see or be able to complete assigned forms."

      "question": "Why isn’t my client receiving the forms through the portal? Are there requirements they might be missing?",
      "answer": "This usually happens when a required condition is not met. Verify that the client (1) has an active portal account, (2) has a valid email address in their profile, and (3) can successfully authenticate in the portal (web or mobile). If any of these are missing, assigned forms may not appear."

      "question": "What steps must a client complete before they can receive assigned forms through the portal?",
      "answer": "Use this setup flow: (1) ensure the client’s portal account is created and active, (2) confirm a valid email address is registered in the client profile, and (3) verify the client can sign in to the portal (web or mobile). After these steps, assigned forms will be available in the portal."

      "question": "Does the client need to have an active portal account to receive forms?",
      "answer": "Yes. Portal activation is required for the client to receive and complete assigned forms. If the account is not active, the client will not see the forms."

      "intent": "error",
      "question": "My client is not receiving any forms—could it be because their portal account is not active?",
      "answer": "Yes, this issue often occurs when the client's portal account is inactive. A client must have an active portal account to receive assigned forms. If the account is inactive, the portal will not display or deliver forms. Reactivating the account usually resolves the problem."

      "question": "At what point in the setup flow does the client need an active portal account to receive forms?",
      "answer": "The client must have an active portal account early in the setup flow. After the account is activated, the system can assign forms and make them available in the portal. Without an active account, the workflow cannot continue and forms cannot be delivered."

      "question": "A client isn’t receiving form notifications—could this be because they don’t have a registered email in their profile?",
      "answer": "Yes. If the client does not have a registered email in their profile, the portal cannot complete activation or send form-related notifications. Make sure the email is added and that it matches the one the client uses to log in to the portal. Missing or mismatched emails commonly cause this issue."

      "answer": "The client needs a registered email early in the setup flow. The email is required to activate the portal account and to enable delivery of form notifications. Once the email is added and matches the one the client uses to log in, the system can continue the workflow and allow the client to receive and complete assigned forms."

      "answer": "Staff must have permissions to: (1) view the client, (2) access the forms module, (3) assign portal forms, and if applicable, (4) link forms to appointments. Without these permissions, assignment may fail or be unavailable."

      "question": "The form isn’t appearing as assignable in the portal—could it be missing the required portal configuration?",
      "answer": "Yes. This issue typically occurs when the form is not properly configured for portal use. The form must be enabled for portal, published or marked as available, and set to allow client submission. If any of these requirements are missing, the system will prevent the form from being assigned."

      "question": "At what step in the setup workflow must the form be enabled, published, and configured for client submission so it can be assigned to the portal?",
      "answer": "During the form‑setup workflow, the form must be configured before reaching the assignment step. Specifically, it needs to be enabled for portal, published or available, and set to allow client submission. Once these configuration steps are completed, the form becomes eligible for assignment in the portal."

      "answer": "This issue often occurs when one of the required steps or configurations for form assignment is missing. Staff must be able to search and select the client, choose a form that is enabled for the portal, and—if applicable—link it to the correct appointment before sending the assignment. If the form is not enabled for portal use or the workflow is incomplete, the assignment may fail or not appear for the client."

      "answer": "Recommended flow: (1) Search and select the client, (2) choose the form enabled for portal, (3) link it to the corresponding appointment (recommended), (4) send the assignment. The client will receive the notification and can complete it in the portal."

      "question": "Why isn’t the form appearing for all clients—does the system prevent assigning the same form to multiple people?",
      "answer": "No. The system allows assigning the same form to multiple clients. If the form isn't appearing for some clients, it’s usually because a required step in the assignment flow was missed or the form isn’t properly configured for portal use. You can assign the same form repeatedly as long as the form meets the portal requirements."

      "answer": "Once a form is submitted, the system converts it into a finalized PDF, which makes it non‑editable. This is expected behavior and not an error. If the client needs to make corrections, staff must create a new assignment or issue an additional form so the client can re‑enter the information."
